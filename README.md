# discord-widget-bot

A (very) basic Discord widget embed for your website. It only supports one channel, which is good if you want to embed a Discord channel in your website for your support server.

# Setup

## API

1. Navigate to the `api` folder.
2. Make sure you have `npm` and `typescript` installed globally and run `npm i && tsc`.
3. Create a `config.json` file and configure the credentials (example is included in the `config.example.json` file)
4. Run `node .`.

## Widget

1. Open the `widget/src/App.tsx` file.
2. Configure the REST and WebSocket API host and port.
3. Go back one folder.
4. Run `npm run start`.

## Widget Embed

Check out the `test.html` file for an example.
